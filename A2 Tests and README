Comp2003 Assignment 2

Files submitted:
a2 (executable)
a2.asm
io.mac
io.o
A2 Tests and README


///////////README///////////////
The assignment said to submit the executable and I did but if you want to recompile it copy these commands in the command line on one of the lambdas:
nasm -f elf a2.asm
ld -o a2 -melf_i386 a2.o io.o

Also, the assignment did not ask for the program to restart so it doesnt and the prof said it was NOT one of the requirements in class.


///////////TESTS///////////////
These are my tests:

-All the combinations of K,L,k,l,N are put together below and they all terminated without error
-I start by outputting the input string for each to make sure it is correct
-Then I print every byte that were unpacked from the input string to the 16 byte array to make sure that they are correct
-Then bits 0 and 5 of the lights byte are modified according to the commands that were packed in the 2 byte array
-The bits of the lights byte are outputted to verify if they were modified approprietly
-The program writes a message to tell the user that it has terminated.
